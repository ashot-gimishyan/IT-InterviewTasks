Within the project, we collect, analyze and classify various tasks that are commonly asked in Python-related job interviews. The tasks range from simple questions on understanding the basics of Python and standard algorithms to more complex problems that require knowledge of specific libraries and frameworks. The goal of "Python-InterviewTasks" is to help each participant become more qualified and competitive in the IT job market.
